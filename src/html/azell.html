        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Azell Cavaan</h1>
        <p>Azell Cavaan is an award-winning journalist who earned her master’s degree from the
            Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Chicago, one of the nation’s
            premiere journalism schools. She is the published author of thousands of articles that have
            appeared in newspapers and magazines both nationally and internationally.
            <br>
            <br> Cavaan’s wide-ranging experience in the media industry includes having held staff writing
            positions for The Springfield Republican, the Boston Herald, the Boston South End News,
            the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin and London’s Legalease publications. In 1996, she covered
            Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. as a correspondent for The Waterloo Courier. Cavaan’s
            extensive career also includes working as a journalism professor and media advisor at
            Northeastern University in Boston.
            <br>
            <br> During her more than 20-year tenure as a journalist, Cavaan interviewed such well-known
            individuals as President Bill Clinton, Spike Lee, Maya Angelou and many others. Yet, she
            remains most moved by interviews she has conducted with ordinary people overcoming
            extraordinary circumstances, or in her words, “true everyday heroes.”
            <br>
            <br> In 2007, former Mayor Charles V. Ryan solicited Cavaan to the newly created position of
            Communications Director for the City of Springfield. Proudly, she continued to hold that
            position under the administration of the City’s current mayor, the Honorable Domenic J.
            Sarno.
            <br>
            <br> Following her City Hall experience, Cavaan single-handedly created the Office of
            Communications for Springfield Public Schools, an organization with more than 4,000
            employees and an annual operating budget of more than $500 million. Currently, she is the
            Chief Communications Officer for Springfield Public Schools
            <br><br>
            In 2007, Governor Deval L. Patrick appointed Cavaan to the Massachusetts Commission on
            the Status of Women.  She is a former board member of the Dunbar Community Center,
            Willie Ross School for the Deaf and Early Childhood Centers of Greater Springfield. She
            currently serves on the Boards of Pope Francis Preparatory Academy, The Urban League
            of Greater Springfield and the Massachusetts Women of Color Coalition. She also holds
            memberships with the National Association of Black Journalists, the Society of Professional
            Journalists and the National Schools Public Relations Association.
