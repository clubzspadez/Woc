        <h1>Coretta T. McCarter, Ed.D.</h1>
        <p>Brenda Jenkins has been working with vulnerable populations for 30 years. Brenda is
            committed as well as dedicated to improving the lives of men/women of color in addressing
            health disparities, social determinants, racism, and implicit bias that impact black/brown
            families.
            <br><br>
            Brenda was the former YMCA Health and Wellness Director and Community Relations Director
            that oversaw the Men’s Health and Families Department for the last 15 year that connected
            families to health services, in the area of oral health, medical services and primary care
            physicians.
            <br><br>
            Brenda is currently the YMCA Central Branch Community Wellness Coordinator that oversees
            the Live Strong Cancer Program, and Enhance Fitness Program for seniors, Women Health
            Network Program that outreach to women who do not access Community Health Centers and
            in need of mammograms /cervical cancer screenings.
            She is the Visionary and Founding Member Founder for Massachusetts Women Of Color
            Coalition, the Chair for Health and Wellness Platform. In addition, Brenda is a leader in the
            Black Family Movement in Worcester that are organizing and mobilizing on racial equities.
            <br><br>
            Brenda is the Co-Founder/President Mosaic Cultural Complex of a multi-faceted, multi-
            dimensional organization that empowers, educates, and repairs men of color from across the
            county.
            <br><br>
            In 2010 Henry Lee Willis and Mosaic and partners establish Men’s Health Alliance. Mosaic has
            convened a broad spectrum of institutions and community members that bring a variety of
            expertise and experiences related to the health and wellness of Men of Color (MOC).  Members
            were strategically invited to the team because of their lens, expertise, resources, and access
            points they embody.  This group consists of barbers, CBO’s, mental health professionals,
            community organizers, public health, wellness, medical professionals, and clergy that have
            demonstrated a commitment to the health/ wellness of MOC through their work in the
            community. Most importantly, the majority of the consortium is comprised of MOC that
            represent the class, educational, employment, sexual orientation, and religious diversity
            within the Black and Latino communities of Worcester. This structure is intentional and allows
            for the design of the model to be led by MOC with the technical expertise contributed by
            professionals that also largely consist of MOC.
            <br><br>
            The coalition structure includes a Steering Committee, the full MOC Coalition which consists
            of all members of the coalition, and the Work Groups which are organized by strategic
            program activities. Through that course of action we develop Mosaic Barbershop Health
            Network where we collected data by race, ethnicity and disparities indicators. We expand
            community based participatory research and translation, form strategic multidisciplinary
            partnerships, advocate policy and system change and accelerate health among men of color.
            Mosaic is data driven environment that utilizes a national recognized web-based evaluation
            system Efforts to Outcome (ETO). This system allows us to track time and energy for every
            individual we work with, and provide outcomes we are looking for.
            <br><br>
            Brenda understands the issues that affect black/brown communities; such as health
            disparities; reparation, safety, health, and quality of life are issues that are important to these
            communities. I am a global thinker who identifies needs and visualize critical solutions. I
            PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09)
            adept at evaluating and addressing challenging problems that impact black/brown
            communities on a daily basis.
